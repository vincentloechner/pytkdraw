"""Basic interface to the tkdraw.screen module.

This module provides four elementary functions to:

- open a window
- plot a pixel at a given position in the window
- refresh the window (at any step of your program)
- wait for the user to close the window

All these functions return nothing (None).
A python exception (`AssertionError`, `InterruptedError` or `ValueError`) will
be raised if any precondition of those functions is not met, and an explicit
error message will be given.

Test this module using `python3 -m tkdraw.basic`

Example:
    ```py
    import tkdraw.basic as graph

    # size of the window (pixels)
    HEIGHT = 400
    WIDTH = 600

    # open the window
    graph.open(HEIGHT, WIDTH)

    # plot a horizontal line in the middle
    for j in range(WIDTH):
        graph.plot(HEIGHT//2, j)

    # wait for the user to close the window
    graph.wait()
    ```
