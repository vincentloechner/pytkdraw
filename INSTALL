HOWTO build and update the package on pypi from the git tree:

0. Check version number and package name
- each upload must have a different version number
- for testing add your real name to the project name

1. build the archives from the main repository:
python3 -m build

2. upload them to pypi test repo:
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
or on the pypi main repo (rename the project as 'tkdraw', no name extension):
python3 -m twine upload dist/*

3. test it in a python3 virtual environment:
# create a virtual venv:
python3 -m venv ./python_venv_testing
# jump to the venv:
source ./python_venv_testing/bin/activate
# install the module here from the test repo:
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps tkdraw_VincentLoechner
# or from the main repo:
python3 -m pip install tkdraw

# test it
python3
>>> import tkdraw
>>> from tkdraw import screen
>>> help(screen.open)

HOWTO move to development mode:
